    "\n",
    "There are many consumers in an economy whose labor productivity $x$ and non-labor income $\\pi$ are different. An individual consumer is endowed with one unit of time that can be used on either working to make money for consumption or enjoying as leisure. The wage per hour is given by $w$ that is determined in the market. The utility function of the consumer is given by $ u(c, l) = c^{\\frac{1}{3}} l^{\\frac{2}{3}}$, where $c$ and $l$ denote consumption and leisure respectively."
