    "Let's simulate an individual worker's turnovers in the labor market stock variables for $T=50,000$ again. Now, suppose that the following changes in transition probabilites will take place in period $\\hat{T} = 20,000$: $\\hat{\\alpha} = 0.03$ and $\\hat{\\delta} = 0.05$. Write codes for simulating and plotting the individual worker's turnovers across labor market states over time as you did in Q.2-4.\n"
